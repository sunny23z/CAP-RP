# CAP-RP

Near-field large-amplitude seismograms are essential for the rapid inversion of earthquake source parameters using waveform inversion methods such as the Cut And Paste (CAP) for disaster assessment. High-rate Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) relative positioning (RP) provides precise, rapid, and real-time measurement of near-field large-amplitude displacements. However, RP records motion with respect to a reference station, and the reference station’s movements become part of the relative displacement waveforms. Therefore, seismic source parameter estimates may be inaccurate if the reference station’s motion is not taken into consideration, and doing so affects some basic assumptions made in the CAP method. To overcome this problem, we develop an expanded differential CAP inversion approach specifically for high-rate GNSS RP (CAP-RP) that accounts for the motion of the reference station. Two methods are proposed to implement CAP-RP: an expanded differential CAP (D-CAP) and an iterative post-processing CAP (P-CAP).
